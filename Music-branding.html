    <h2>Head First Band</h2>
      <p>A Berklee College of Music rock band, Head First needed a comprehensive visual campaign for their album rollout. I shot them across four distinct locations, starting with their debut set opening for Woodfern at The Red Room @Berklee where I captured, edited, and delivered photos before they even left the stage. For their "All Flower" single, we shot in the woods using natural light to create organic promotional imagery. I then filmed studio performance videos showcasing their raw energy, followed by a final professional photo studio session with custom props and lighting that produced individual portraits, group shots, and abstract imagery for broader visual assets. This progression built their complete visual story from live energy to polished branding.</p>

    <h2>Joanne the Band</h2>  <!-- TITLE FIRST -->
            <p>Joanne the Band is a Boston folk duo who met working the performance and booking side at City Winery Boston. As they began booking bigger shows and getting their names on more bills, they needed professional promotional photography to match their growing presence. Using their carefully curated Pinterest board as inspiration, I directed a creative studio shoot that captured their folk authenticity through warm lighting, natural textures, and acoustic intimacy. The resulting images established their signature visual identity which they've used across multiple venues. I also documented their live performance at the iconic Club Passim, providing them with both promotional and live action content for their ongoing bookings.</p>

    <h2>S and R</h2>  <!-- TITLE FIRST -->
       <p>S and R is a Berklee alternative duo whose sound demanded bold visual representation. I collaborated with them across two major shoots - the first establishing their core branding imagery, the second an immersive maximalist album artwork session specifically designed to capture the chaotic party energy of their upcoming release. This high-concept shoot featured bold colors, dynamic poses, and layered textures that translated their experimental sound into striking visuals. The resulting photos gained publication traction around their music releases, significantly amplifying their professional presence across industry platforms and social channels.</p>

    <h2>Evil Felipe</h2>  <!-- TITLE FIRST -->
            <p>Evil Felipe is a Worcester, MA girl rock band with a story as compelling as their sound. Formed in 2016 when the dads of sisters Ella and Maya Staltare and Emma Bain - who used to play music together themselves - brought their daughters with shared musical interests together to create this powerhouse trio. The family legacy continues with bassist Abby Rickert joining in 2021 to complete the lineup. After seeing my work with other bands, Evil Felipe called me to capture their visual identity ahead of upcoming shows and new music releases. These photos will serve as their promotional foundation across live performances, social media, and official release artwork, carrying forward the legacy these families built through music.</p>
