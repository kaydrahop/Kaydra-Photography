        <h1>Kaydra Hopkins</h1>
        <h2>Creative Director & MBA Candidate</h2>
        <p>I’m Kaydra Hopkins, currently a second-year MBA student at Northeastern University’s D’Amore-McKim School of Business, specializing in Marketing and Media. My passion lies in crafting impactful campaigns within the music and entertainment industry that drive both fan engagement and business growth. I hold a Bachelor of Science degree from Northeastern University, where I pursued a dual focus in Business Administration and Political Science, gaining valuable insights into social innovation and legal studies. Before that, I graduated as valedictorian from Boston Arts Academy, where my foundation in creative expression and business sparked my interest in the entertainment field.</p>
        <p>I bring a diverse range of experiences to the table, including six years in the restaurant industry, seven years in construction with roles both onsite and administrative, one year in legal administration, three years as a freelance photographer, and two years working in security and operations at music venues. This broad background has honed my skills in effective time management and enables me to approach challenges with a unique and insightful perspective.</p>
